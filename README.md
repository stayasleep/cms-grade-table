# SGT - Student Grade Table


#### Description
Version 0.5 starts off with adding in the delete functionality. When clicking on the delete button we need
to add an event handler that will remove the current row from the DOM only after we have successfully removed the object
from the array.


## Version 1.0
#### Description
Version 1.0 picks up where 0.5 left off. You will now be populating records from a database.


## Version 2.0
#### Description
Version 2.0 adds more CRUD functionality.  Previously you added R (Read), and now you will be adding Create and Delete functionality. You will now be adding records to a database via the SGT API you create.
